## Objective
To understand how network scanning is performed and how services running on open ports are enumerated using Nmap.

## What is Network Scanning?
Network scanning is the process of identifying open ports on the target system along with the services running on those ports.

## Tool Used
- Nmap

## Scan Performed
- Initial automation scan using default scripts
- Manual scanning using SYN and TCP scans for deeper analysis

## Command Used
```bash
nmap 192.168.154.130 -v -p 1-65535 -sV -sC -O

nmap 192.168.154.130 -v -p 1-65535 -sV -sS -A -O -oX ameya.xml

## Explanation of Scan Flags

- -p 1-65535 : Scans all TCP ports to avoid missing hidden services
- -sS : SYN scan for stealth and speed
- -sV : Service version detection
- -sC : Runs default Nmap scripts for basic enumeration
- -A : Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute
- -O : Attempts OS fingerprinting
- -oX : Saves output in XML format for future parsing and automation

## Why Network Scanning is Important in Pentesting

Network scanning helps identify the attack surface of a target by revealing
open ports and services. Each exposed service can potentially contain
misconfigurations or vulnerabilities that can be exploited in later phases
of penetration testing.
