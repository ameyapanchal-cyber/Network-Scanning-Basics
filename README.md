# Network Scanning Basics – Pentesting Labs

This repository documents my hands-on learning and practice of
network scanning and firewall evasion techniques as part of my
web penetration testing journey.

The focus of this repository is to understand how attackers
identify live hosts, discover services, and analyze firewall behavior
using Nmap and related techniques.
